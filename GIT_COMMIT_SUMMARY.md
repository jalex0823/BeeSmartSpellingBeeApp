## ⚠️ Notes

### Line Ending Warnings:
Git issued warnings about LF → CRLF conversion for 4 OBJ/MTL files:
- `Bee_Blossom_1015233630_texture.mtl`
- `Bee_Blossom_1015233630_texture.obj`
- `Bee_Smiley_1015233733_texture.mtl`
- `Bee_Smiley_1015233733_texture.obj`

**Impact:** None - Git will handle line ending conversion automatically

### Large Binary Files:
The 3D model files (.obj, .png) contributed to the 48.60 MiB upload size. Consider using Git LFS for future large binary assets if repository grows significantly.

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Test on GitHub:** Verify all files appear correctly in repository
2. **Railway Deployment:** Changes will auto-deploy if connected
3. **3D Bee Implementation:** Ready to use OBJ files with Three.js
4. **Feature Testing:** Test name card, quiz ending, music notes in production
