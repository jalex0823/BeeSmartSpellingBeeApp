## 🎯 How It Works

### Teacher Workflow:
1. Teacher opens BeeSmart app
2. Uploads/generates word list (or uses existing)
3. Clicks "⚔️ Battle of the Bees"
4. Enters battle name (e.g., "Mrs. Smith's Vocabulary Test")
5. Enters their name
6. Clicks "Create Battle"
7. Gets unique code (e.g., "BATTLE123")
8. Shares code with students (write on board, email, etc.)

### Student Workflow:
1. Student opens BeeSmart app
2. Clicks "⚔️ Battle of the Bees"
3. Switches to "Join the Battle" tab
4. Enters battle code (BATTLE123)
5. Enters their name (e.g., "Alice")
6. Clicks "Join Battle"
7. Word list loads automatically
8. Clicks "Start Battle" to begin spelling
9. Progress automatically tracked in real-time

### Scoring System:
- **Base Score**: 100 points per correct word
- **Speed Bonuses**:
  - Under 5 seconds: +50 points
  - Under 10 seconds: +25 points
  - Under 15 seconds: +10 points
- **Streak Multipliers**:
  - 3+ streak: 1.5x multiplier
  - 5+ streak: 2.0x multiplier
  - 10+ streak: 3.0x multiplier

Example scoring:
- Word answered in 4 seconds with 5-word streak:
- (100 + 50) × 2.0 = **300 points!**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Battle Code Format:
- Pattern: `BATTLE###` (e.g., BATTLE123, BATTLE456)
- Length: 9 characters
- Numbers: 100-999
- Auto-generated, collision-checked

### Fairness Features:
✅ **Single Word List**: All students get THE SAME words
✅ **Synchronized Shuffle**: Same order for everyone (using shuffle_seed)
✅ **Isolated Progress**: One student's answers don't affect others
✅ **Real-time Updates**: Leaderboard updates after each answer
✅ **No Editing**: Word list locked after battle creation
✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Can't use same name twice in one battle

### Limits & Constraints:
- **Max Players**: 50 per battle
- **Max Battles**: Unlimited (auto-cleanup after 24 hours)
- **Expiration**: 24 hours from creation
- **Word Count**: Depends on uploaded list (typically 10-50)

## 💡 Tips for Teachers

1. **Test First**: Create a test battle before class to ensure word list is loaded
2. **Share Early**: Give students code at start of class to allow time to join
3. **Clear Instructions**: Write code clearly on board (easy to misread)
4. **Monitor Joins**: Check leaderboard to see who's joined
5. **Set Expectations**: Explain scoring system before starting
6. **Time Limits**: Remind students they have 24 hours (or set your own deadline)
7. **Fair Play**: Ensure all students start at same time
8. **Technical Issues**: Have backup plan if connectivity issues arise
