# Dynamic Player Name Usage Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the quiz announcer to use the player's name more naturally and variably, making the experience feel more personalized and less repetitive.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Feedback Messages** (`getRandomFeedback`)
- **Before**: All feedback messages were generic without names
- **After**: 40% chance to add student name in one of three positions:
  - **Beginning**: "Sarah, üêù bee-utiful! That's correct!"
  - **Middle**: "üêù BEE-utiful! Sarah, you nailed it!"
  - **End**: "üêù BEE-utiful! That's correct, Sarah!"
- Added more feedback variations (19 positive, 18 negative messages)

### 2. **Audio Announcements** (`getRandomAudioAnnouncement`)
- **Before**: Always had name prefix if student name exists
- **After**: 30% chance to vary the name placement:
  - Remove from beginning and add at end
  - Or omit entirely for variety
- Prevents repetitive "Sarah, Fantastic! Sarah, Excellent! Sarah, Amazing!"

### 3. **Next Word Introductions**
- **Before**: Always "Your next word is: [word]"
- **After**: 7 varied phrases randomly selected:
  - "Your next word is: [word]"
  - "Now, spell: [word]"
  - "Ready for this one? [word]"
  - "Here comes: [word]"
  - "Let's try: [word]"
  - "Next up: [word]"
  - "Spell this word: [word]"
- **Plus**: 30% chance to add name in varied positions:
  - "Sarah, your next word is: [word]"
  - "Next up: [word], Sarah!"
  - "Alright Sarah, ready for this one? [word]"

## User Experience Improvements

### Natural Conversation Flow
- Announcer feels more like a real person, not a robot
- Name usage varies naturally between:
  - Using full name
  - Using name with excitement (e.g., "Sarah!")
  - Sometimes no name at all

### Reduced Repetition
- Student hears their name sometimes, but not every time
- Creates moments of surprise and delight when name appears
- More engaging than constant name repetition

### Authentic Spelling Bee Feel
- Mimics real spelling bee announcers who vary their language
- Professional yet friendly tone
- Keeps students engaged throughout long practice sessions

## Technical Details

### Probability Settings
- **Feedback messages**: 40% name insertion chance
- **Audio announcements**: 30% name variation chance
- **Next word intro**: 30% name addition chance

### Name Placement Logic
```javascript
// Random position (0 = start, 1 = middle, 2 = end)
const position = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
```

### Name Variations
- Plain name: "Sarah"
- With excitement: "Sarah!"
- With context: "Alright Sarah"

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with student name**: Set name in localStorage and observe varied usage
2. **Test without name**: Ensure messages still work gracefully
3. **Long session test**: Do 20+ words to see variety in action
4. **Audio test**: Verify speech synthesis handles name insertions properly

## Future Enhancements
- Add milestone celebrations with name ("Sarah, you've spelled 10 words!")
- Use name more frequently during streaks ("Sarah's on fire!")
- Add encouraging phrases with name after mistakes ("Don't worry, Sarah!")
- Context-aware name usage (use more when student seems discouraged)
