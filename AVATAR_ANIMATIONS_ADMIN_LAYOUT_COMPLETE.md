## 🔧 Technical Details

### Avatar Animation System (`admin/dashboard.html`):

```javascript
// Theme-based animation mapping
const avatarAnimations = {
    'rocker': {
        animation: 'rockerShred 1.5s ease-in-out',
        particles: ['🎸', '🎵', '⚡', '🔥'],
        colors: ['#FF1744', '#9C27B0', '#FF6B00'],
        sound: 'rock'
    },
    // ... other themes
};

function playAvatarAnimation() {
    // Auto-detects avatar theme and plays appropriate animation
    // Creates particle effects around avatar
    // Integrates with existing 3D avatar system
}
```

### CSS Animations:
- **10 unique keyframe animations** (rockerShred, vampFly, professorThink, etc.)
- **Particle system** with floating effects
- **Responsive design** maintains mobile compatibility

### Avatar Detection:
- Integrates with existing `window.userAvatarLoader` system
- Extracts theme from avatar folder path
- Falls back to default mascot theme if detection fails

## 🎨 Avatar Asset Integration

Utilizes existing 3D OBJ files from `/static/assets/avatars/`:
- `rocker-bee/RockerBee.obj` → Rock animation
- `vamp-bee/VampBee.obj` → Vampire animation
- `professor-bee/ProfessorBee.obj` → Professor animation
- `doctor-bee/DoctorBee.obj` → Doctor animation
- `monster-bee/MonsterBee.obj` → Monster animation
- `anxious-bee/AnxiousBee.obj` → Anxious animation
- `ware-bee/WareBee.obj` → Energetic animation
- `zom-bee/ZomBee.obj` → Zombie animation
- `al-bee/AlBee.obj` → Performance animation
