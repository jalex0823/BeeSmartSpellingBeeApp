### Data Flow
```
1. User registers ‚Üí bcrypt hash ‚Üí User table ‚Üí TeacherStudent link (if key provided)
2. User logs in ‚Üí Flask-Login session ‚Üí Redirect to role-based dashboard
3. Quiz starts ‚Üí Create QuizSession if logged in, else use session storage
4. Quiz answers ‚Üí Save QuizResult + update WordMastery if logged in
