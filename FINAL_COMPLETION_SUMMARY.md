### 4. ✅ Quiz Database Integration
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

**Endpoints Modified:**
1. **`/api/quiz/start`**
   - Creates `QuizSession` record in database for logged-in users
   - Stores quiz metadata (word count, start time, difficulty)
   - Returns quiz session UUID

2. **`/api/answer`**
   - Saves each answer to `QuizResult` table
   - Updates/creates `WordMastery` records
   - Tracks: correctness, time taken, points earned, streak, hints used
   - Calculates word difficulty and success rates

3. **`/api/quiz/complete`**
   - Finalizes `QuizSession` with completion stats
   - Calculates grade (A+, A, B, C, D, F)
   - Updates user stats (total_points, total_quizzes_completed, best_streak)
   - Commits all changes to database

**Guest Mode:** Still works! Non-logged-in users use session storage only (no database).

### 5. ✅ Dashboard Implementation
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

**Dashboards Created:**
1. **Student Dashboard** (`/auth/dashboard`)
   - Shows: total quizzes, total points, best streak, achievements
   - Lists recent quiz sessions with grades
   - Word mastery progress (words needing review)
   - Start new quiz button

2. **Teacher Dashboard** (`/auth/dashboard`)
   - View all students linked via teacher key
   - Student progress overview
   - Recent quiz activity across all students
   - Export data functionality

3. **Admin Dashboard** (`/auth/dashboard`)
   - All users overview
   - System statistics
   - User management tools
   - Full database access

---

### 6. ✅ Guest Mode Compatibility
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Verified in code)

**How It Works:**
- ✅ `current_user.is_authenticated` checks before database operations
- ✅ Session storage used for guest word banks and quiz state
- ✅ All quiz endpoints work without user_id
- ✅ No database errors for guests
- ✅ Full quiz functionality available
