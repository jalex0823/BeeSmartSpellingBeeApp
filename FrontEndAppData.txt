1) Frontend ‚Äúsafety blanker‚Äù (immediate)
Even when we start getting real examples, some sources include the word itself in the sentence. Add this small helper so the quiz always hides the word if it appears:

In quiz.html, near the top of your <script>, add:

function hideTargetWord(text, word) {
  if (!text || !word) return text || '';
  const esc = word.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
  return text.replace(new RegExp(`\\b${esc}\\b`, 'gi'), '_____');
}
Then, in both places you set the definition (inside loadNextWordWithIntro() and loadNextWord()), wrap the chosen text:

// after you pick sentence/hint/definition into `chosen`
const chosen =
  data.sentence || (data.hint ? `Hint: ${data.hint}` : data.definition);

defBox.textContent = hideTargetWord(chosen, data.word);
This guarantees the quiz never leaks the word‚Äîeven if a definition/sentence contains it.

2) Backend: why you‚Äôre getting the fallback, and how to fix it properly
Your app shows ‚Äú‚ö†Ô∏è Dictionary API not available‚Äù at startup, so DICT_LOOKUP() falls back to a placeholder.

get_word_info() detects the placeholder and switches to generate_smart_fallback(), which creates the generic text you‚Äôre seeing.  

Two options
Option A ‚Äî wire up a real dictionary
Provide a working dictionary_api module (or swap in your own implementation) so DICT_LOOKUP(word) returns:

{"definition": "...", "example": "...", "phonetic": "..."}
Once that‚Äôs present, the backend will cache and use real definitions automatically (no UI changes needed).  

Option B ‚Äî improve the fallback (quick band-aid)
If you don‚Äôt have an API yet, make the fallback more educational. Edit generate_smart_fallback() to return a slightly richer ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù and an example that still keeps the blank. (File: AjaSpellBApp.py.) 

3) (Nice to have) Backend auto-blanker
Even when an API is available, some examples include the word. Add this sanitization so the server always replaces the word with blanks before sending it:

In AjaSpellBApp.py, put this helper:

def _blank_word(text, word):
    if not text or not word:
        return text or ""
    return re.sub(rf"\b{re.escape(word)}\b", "_____", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
Use it in get_word_info() right before returning:

definition = api_result.get("definition", "")
example = api_result.get("example", "")
example = _blank_word(example, word)  # <-- ensure the word is hidden

return f"{definition}. Fill in the blank: {example}"
And (belt-and-suspenders) in /api/next right before building the JSON:

sentence = _blank_word((word_rec.get("sentence") or "").strip(), word_rec.get("word",""))
Now both backend and frontend will hide the target word, and once a real dictionary is connected you‚Äôll see true definitions with a proper fill-in-the-blank sentence.

If you want, I can drop in a minimal dictionary_api example (e.g., using a free source) that matches your current interface so you get real definitions right away.

Save that file as

in the same directory as your AjaSpellBApp.py.

Ensure requests is installed:

pip install requests
Restart your Flask app.
You should now see this in the startup log:

Re-upload your word list or run:

POST /api/build_dictionary

üß† What it gives you
For each word:
