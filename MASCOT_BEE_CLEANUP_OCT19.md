# Mascot Bee Cleanup - October 19, 2025

## Summary
Removed floating 3D bee swarm animations and standardized all references from "Smarty Bee" to "Mascot Bee" for clarity and consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Floating Bee Swarm Animation
**File:** `templates/unified_menu.html`

#### CSS Removed:
- `.bee-swarm` container styles
- `.bee` element styles with gradient stripes
- `.bee::before` and `.bee::after` wing animations
- `@keyframes beeFlight` - horizontal flight animation
- `@keyframes beeBuzz` - vertical bobbing animation
- `@keyframes wingFlap` - wing flapping animation
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion)` accessibility rules for bees

#### HTML Removed:
- `<canvas id="beeSwarmCanvas">` - 3D bee swarm canvas element
- `<div class="bee-swarm" id="beeSwarm">` - CSS fallback container

#### JavaScript Removed:
- `MenuBeeSwarm3D` initialization code
- `MenuBeeSwarmCSS` fallback initialization
- Error handling try/catch for bee swarm loading

### 2. Renamed "Smarty Bee" to "Mascot Bee"

#### Container ID Updates:
- `#smartyBee3D` → `#mascotBee3D` (CSS selector)
- `<div id="smartyBee3D">` → `<div id="mascotBee3D">` (HTML element)

#### JavaScript Variable Updates:
- `window.smartyBee` → `window.mascotBee`
- All `getElementById('smartyBee3D')` → `getElementById('mascotBee3D')`

#### Comments Updated:
- "Smarty Bee 3D Mascot" → "Mascot Bee 3D Component"
- "Initialize Smarty Bee mascot" → "Initialize Mascot Bee"
- Console log: "Smarty Bee mascot initialized" → "Mascot Bee initialized"

### 3. Previous 3D Model Path Fix (Completed Earlier)

#### Template Changes:
Added global base URL for model assets:
```javascript
window.BEE_MODEL_BASE = "{{ url_for('static', filename='models') }}/";
```

#### Loader Script Updates (`static/js/smarty-bee-3d.js`):
- Changed model path construction to use `BEE_MODEL_BASE`
- Added `.setPath()` and `.setResourcePath()` to MTL/OBJ loaders
- Added `addFallbackBee()` method for graceful degradation (3D sphere fallback)
- Added diagnostic logging for missing OBJ files
- Improved error handling in model loading

## Files Modified
1. `templates/unified_menu.html` - Main template cleanup and renaming
2. `static/js/smarty-bee-3d.js` - Model loading path fixes (earlier)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] OBJ file exists at `static/models/MascotBee_1019174653_texture.obj`
- [ ] Page loads without 404 errors for OBJ/MTL files
- [ ] Mascot bee renders correctly in 3D container
- [ ] No floating bees appear on page load
- [ ] Fallback emoji bee shows if 3D fails
- [ ] Console shows "Mascot Bee initialized" instead of "Smarty Bee"
- [ ] Mobile responsive layout still works

## Visual Changes
- **Removed:** Animated flying bees across the screen
- **Kept:** Magic background sparkles and fairy trails
- **Kept:** Single mascot bee in logo section (now properly named)

## Notes
- The JavaScript class `SmartyBee3D` in `smarty-bee-3d.js` was intentionally kept as-is to avoid breaking references. Only the variable names and HTML IDs were updated.
- The file `smarty-bee-3d.js` could be renamed to `mascot-bee-3d.js` in a future cleanup if desired, but would require updating the script tag reference.
- All 3D model assets remain in `static/models/` and are loaded via the injected `BEE_MODEL_BASE` path.

## Rollback Instructions
If needed, restore from git:
```powershell
git checkout HEAD -- templates/unified_menu.html
```

The floating bee swarm code can be restored from git history if the effect is desired in the future.
