# 🎓 GPA & Grade Accumulation System - How It Works

## ✅ YES! The System DOES Accumulate All Quizzes

The GPA tracking system **automatically accumulates data from ALL completed quizzes** for each user. Here's exactly how:

---

## 📊 What Gets Accumulated

### 1. **Cumulative GPA** (0.00 - 4.00 scale)
- Average of letter grades from **all completed quizzes**
- Each quiz grade is converted to GPA points:
  - A+ / A = 4.0
  - A- = 3.7
  - B+ = 3.3
  - B = 3.0
  - B- = 2.7
  - C+ = 2.3
  - C = 2.0
  - C- = 1.7
  - D+ = 1.3
  - D = 1.0
  - D- = 0.7
  - F = 0.0

**Formula:**
```
Cumulative GPA = Sum of all quiz GPAs / Number of completed quizzes
```

### 2. **Average Accuracy** (%)
- Average accuracy percentage from **all completed quizzes**

**Formula:**
```
Average Accuracy = Sum of all quiz accuracies / Number of completed quizzes
```

### 3. **Best Grade**
- The **highest letter grade** ever achieved across all quizzes
- Example: If you get B+, A-, B, A+, then Best Grade = A+

### 4. **Best Streak**
- The **longest consecutive correct answers** across all quizzes
- Example: Quiz 1 streak=5, Quiz 2 streak=8, Quiz 3 streak=3 → Best Streak = 8

### 5. **Total Quizzes Completed**
- Count of all completed quizzes

### 6. **Total Lifetime Points**
- Sum of all points earned from all quizzes

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### When You Complete a Quiz:

1. **Quiz Session is Created** (when quiz starts)
   - New `QuizSession` record in database
   - Tracks: user_id, start time, word count

2. **Each Word is Answered**
   - `QuizResult` record saved for each word
   - Tracks: correct/incorrect, time taken, points earned

3. **Quiz Completes** (when all words answered)
   ```python
   quiz_session.complete_session()
   ```
   - Calculates accuracy: `correct / total * 100`
   - Calculates letter grade based on accuracy:
     - 97%+ = A+
     - 93-96% = A
     - 90-92% = A-
     - 87-89% = B+
     - 83-86% = B
     - 80-82% = B-
     - 77-79% = C+
     - 73-76% = C
     - 70-72% = C-
     - 67-69% = D+
     - 63-66% = D
     - 60-62% = D-
     - <60% = F
   - Marks session as `completed=True`

4. **User Stats Updated**
   ```python
   current_user.update_gpa_and_accuracy()
   ```
   - Queries **ALL completed quiz sessions** for this user:
     ```python
     completed_sessions = QuizSession.query.filter_by(
         user_id=self.id,
         completed=True
     ).all()
     ```
   - Loops through every quiz and sums up:
     - GPA points (converts each grade to 4.0 scale)
     - Accuracy percentages
     - Finds best grade
     - Finds best streak
   
   - Calculates averages:
     ```python
     self.cumulative_gpa = total_gpa_points / number_of_quizzes
     self.average_accuracy = total_accuracy / number_of_quizzes
     ```

5. **Database Committed**
   ```python
   db.session.commit()
   ```
   - All changes saved to database

6. **Dashboard Updated**
   - Next time you visit dashboard, shows updated stats

## 📈 Example Scenario

### Student: Alex

#### Quiz 1: 10 words
- Correct: 9/10 (90% accuracy)
- Grade: **A-** (GPA: 3.7)
- Points: 500
- Best Streak: 7

- Average Accuracy: **90.0%**
- Best Grade: **A-**
- Best Streak: **7**
- Total Quizzes: **1**

#### Quiz 2: 20 words
- Correct: 17/20 (85% accuracy)
- Grade: **B** (GPA: 3.0)
- Points: 850
- Best Streak: 12

**After Quiz 2:**
- Cumulative GPA: **(3.7 + 3.0) / 2 = 3.35**
- Average Accuracy: **(90 + 85) / 2 = 87.5%**
- Best Grade: **A-** (still the highest)
- Best Streak: **12** (now the highest)
- Total Quizzes: **2**
- Total Points: **500 + 850 = 1,350**

#### Quiz 3: 15 words
- Correct: 15/15 (100% accuracy)
- Grade: **A+** (GPA: 4.0)
- Points: 1200
- Best Streak: 15

**After Quiz 3:**
- Cumulative GPA: **(3.7 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 3 = 3.57**
- Average Accuracy: **(90 + 85 + 100) / 3 = 91.7%**
- Best Grade: **A+** (new highest!)
- Best Streak: **15** (new highest!)
- Total Quizzes: **3**
- Total Points: **1,350 + 1,200 = 2,550**

#### Quiz 4: 10 words
- Correct: 8/10 (80% accuracy)
- Grade: **B-** (GPA: 2.7)
- Points: 400
- Best Streak: 5

**After Quiz 4:**
- Cumulative GPA: **(3.7 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.7) / 4 = 3.35**
- Average Accuracy: **(90 + 85 + 100 + 80) / 4 = 88.75%**
- Best Grade: **A+** (still the highest from Quiz 3)
- Best Streak: **15** (still the highest from Quiz 3)
- Total Quizzes: **4**
- Total Points: **2,550 + 400 = 2,950**

## 🔍 Verification

### To Check Your Data:

Run the verification script:
```powershell
python verify_gpa_storage.py
```

This will show:
- All users in database
- Their cumulative GPA, accuracy, best grade, best streak
- List of all completed quizzes with grades and points
- Verification that data is being stored correctly

---

## 💾 Database Tables

### `users` table stores cumulative stats:
```sql
id | username | cumulative_gpa | average_accuracy | best_grade | best_streak | total_quizzes_completed | total_lifetime_points
```

### `quiz_sessions` table stores each quiz:
```sql
id | user_id | completed | accuracy_percentage | grade | points_earned | max_streak | started_at
```

### `quiz_results` table stores each word:
```sql
id | session_id | user_id | word | is_correct | points_earned | time_taken_seconds
```

## 🔒 Key Points

✅ **Automatic**: GPA recalculates automatically after every quiz
✅ **Cumulative**: Uses ALL completed quizzes, not just recent ones
✅ **Retroactive**: Migration script updated all existing users
✅ **Persistent**: Stored in database, not just in session
✅ **Real-time**: Updated immediately upon quiz completion
✅ **Accurate**: Based on actual quiz performance data

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If GPA shows 0.00 after completing quizzes:

1. **Check quiz was marked complete:**
   ```python
   python verify_gpa_storage.py
   ```
   Should show `completed=True` for quiz sessions

2. **Check Flask logs for:**
   ```
   📈 STATS UPDATE: User=username, Quizzes=X, Points=XXX, GPA=X.XX, Avg Accuracy=XX.X%
   💾 DATABASE COMMITTED
   ```

3. **Verify database columns exist:**
   ```powershell
   python migrate_add_gpa.py
   ```

4. **Check quiz session has grade:**
   - Grade is calculated in `complete_session()`
   - Must have accuracy_percentage to calculate grade
