# 3D Avatar Texture Loading Fix

## Problem Identified
The 3D avatar models (OBJ files) were loading during the splash screen, but the textures (texture.png) were not being applied to the models, resulting in an untextured white/gray appearance.

## Root Cause
The MTL (Material) loader was successfully loading material definitions, but the texture paths referenced in the MTL file were not being resolved correctly by Three.js's MTLLoader. This is a common issue when:
- The MTL file references relative texture paths
- The base path and resource path aren't perfectly aligned
- The texture loader doesn't automatically follow MTL texture references

## Solution Implemented

### File: `static/js/mascot-3d.js`

**Lines 180-278**: Added manual texture loading and application

```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Manually set the texture map for all materials
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
textureLoader.load(
    texPath,
    (texture) => {
        // Apply texture to all materials in the MTL
        for (const materialName in materials.materials) {
            const material = materials.materials[materialName];
            if (material) {
                material.map = texture;
                material.needsUpdate = true;
            }
        }
        // Then load the OBJ with textured materials
    }
);
```

### How It Works
1. **Load MTL first** - Gets material definitions (shininess, colors, etc.)
2. **Manually load texture** - Use TextureLoader to load texture.png directly
3. **Apply to all materials** - Iterate through all materials in the MTL and set `.map = texture`
4. **Set needsUpdate flag** - Ensures Three.js re-renders with new texture
5. **Then load OBJ** - Load the 3D model with properly textured materials applied

### Fallback Handling
Added robust error handling with nested fallbacks:
- If texture loading fails â†’ Load OBJ with materials but no texture
- If MTL loading fails â†’ Use existing fallback method (loadModelWithoutMaterials)
- If everything fails â†’ Show yellow sphere fallback bee

## Testing Verification

### Expected Console Output (Success)
```
âœ… MTL materials loaded successfully
ðŸ”§ Manually loading texture: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/texture.png
âœ… Texture loaded, applying to materials
   Applied texture to material: material_0
Loading model: 100%
âœ… Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!
```

### What Was Broken (Before Fix)
```
âœ… MTL materials loaded successfully
Loading model: 100%
âœ… Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!
[But texture.png wasn't actually applied - model appeared white/gray]
```

## Benefits
- âœ… Avatar textures now display correctly on loading screen
- âœ… Users see their selected avatar with proper colors/details
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility with existing avatar system
- âœ… Robust fallback chain for error handling
- âœ… Better debugging with detailed console logs

## Files Affected
1. **static/js/mascot-3d.js** - Core texture loading fix

## Related Changes in This Commit
1. **Upload Progress Indicator** - Animated honey jar for file uploads
2. **Bigger Avatar Thumbnails** - 200px (up from 140px) for better readability
3. **Back Button** - Return to main menu from avatar picker
4. **Test File** - test_upload_progress.py for progress system validation

## Deployment Notes
- No database changes required
- No environment variable changes
- Clear browser cache after deployment to load updated mascot-3d.js
- Test by selecting different avatars and checking loading screen

## Future Improvements
- Preload all avatar textures on first app load
- Cache loaded textures to avoid re-downloading
- Add texture compression for faster loading
- Support for animated textures (if desired)
