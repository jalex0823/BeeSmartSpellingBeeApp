# BeeSmart Spelling Bee App - All Features Enabled

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL FUNCTIONS RE-ENABLED

## 🎉 What Was Re-Enabled

### OCR & Image Upload
- ✅ **Tesseract OCR** - System dependency added to Dockerfile
- ✅ **pytesseract** - Python library added to requirements.txt
- ✅ **Image Upload** - Users can now upload images with word lists
- ✅ **Image Processing** - OCR extraction from uploaded images

## 📦 Updated Files

### 1. `Dockerfile` - Restored & Updated
```dockerfile
- Restored from Dockerfile.backup
- Includes Tesseract OCR system packages
- Updated to use Railway's $PORT environment variable
- Optimized health check for dynamic port
- Uses gunicorn with 2 workers
```

**Key Changes:**
- `tesseract-ocr` and `tesseract-ocr-eng` packages installed
- Dynamic port binding: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Health check uses environment PORT variable
- Proper cache cleanup for smaller image size

### 2. `requirements.txt` - Updated
```
Flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
Pillow==10.1.0
python-docx==1.1.0
pdfminer.six==20221105
pytesseract==0.3.10  ← ADDED BACK
```

### 3. `railway.json` - Builder Changed
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE",  ← Changed from NIXPACKS
    "dockerfilePath": "Dockerfile"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**Note:** `startCommand` removed because Dockerfile CMD handles it

## 🚀 Deployment Configuration

### Build Process
- **Builder:** Docker (was Nixpacks)
- **Build Time:** ~5-8 minutes (includes system dependencies)
- **Image Size:** ~200-300 MB (includes Tesseract)

### Runtime Configuration
- **Start Command:** `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 2 AjaSpellBApp:app`
- **Workers:** 2 (for better concurrency)
- **Timeout:** 120 seconds (for OCR processing)
- **Health Check:** `/health` endpoint (300s timeout)

   - Upload screenshots
   - Scan printed documents
   - OCR extracts words automatically

2. **Better Performance**
   - 2 worker processes for concurrency
   - Longer timeout for OCR operations
   - Optimized Docker image

3. **Complete Feature Set**
   - All P0, P1, and P2 features active
   - No functionality limitations
   - Full user experience

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Docker Build Stages
1. **Base Image:** Python 3.11-slim
2. **System Packages:** Tesseract OCR + English language data
3. **Python Dependencies:** Install from requirements.txt
4. **Application Code:** Copy all app files
5. **Configuration:** Set up health check and startup

### Railway Deployment
- Detects Dockerfile automatically
- Builds Docker image on Railway servers
- Deploys container to Railway infrastructure
- Health check monitors app availability
- Auto-restart on failure (up to 10 retries)

## 📊 Performance Expectations

### Build Time
- **First Deploy:** 5-8 minutes (includes downloading system packages)
- **Subsequent Deploys:** 2-4 minutes (Docker layer caching)

### Runtime
- **Cold Start:** 30-60 seconds
- **Memory Usage:** ~150-200 MB
- **CPU Usage:** Low (spikes during OCR)

### Response Times
- **Regular Routes:** <100ms
- **OCR Processing:** 2-5 seconds (depending on image)
- **Health Check:** <50ms

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Wait for Railway Outage Resolution**
   - Current status: Network CP outage
   - Monitor: https://status.railway.app/

2. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Railway will detect the push to main branch
   - Automatic build and deploy will trigger
   - Monitor build logs in Railway dashboard

3. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Test image upload functionality
   - Verify OCR extraction works
   - Check all other features still work
   - Monitor performance and errors

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Build Time Impact
- Docker builds take longer than Nixpacks
- First build will take 5-8 minutes
- This is normal due to system dependency installation

### Resource Usage
- Docker image is larger (~200-300 MB)
- Slightly more memory usage due to Tesseract
- Worth it for complete functionality

### Monitoring
- Check Railway logs for any OCR errors
- Monitor build time and success rate
- Watch for Tesseract-related warnings
