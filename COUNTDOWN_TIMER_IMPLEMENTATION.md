## 🍯 What Was Built

### 1. Visual Design - Honey Jar Timer
**Location:** `templates/quiz.html` lines 278-558

**Features:**
- ✅ Transparent jar with golden lid
- ✅ Animated honey fill that drains from top to bottom
- ✅ Bubble animation rising through honey
- ✅ Shimmer effect on honey (breathing animation)
- ✅ Large countdown number below jar
- ✅ Smooth color transitions (green → orange → red)
- ✅ Pulse animations in warning/critical states

**States:**
1. **Normal** (15-6s): Golden honey, calm shimmer
2. **Warning** (5s): Orange honey, gentle pulse, jar glows orange
3. **Critical** (3s): Red honey, faster pulse, red glow, gentle buzz sound
4. **Expired** (0s): Empty jar, gray appearance

### 2. JavaScript CountdownTimer Class
**Location:** `templates/quiz.html` lines 1797-1997

**Features:**
- ✅ Configurable duration (default 15s)
- ✅ Smooth 1-second tick intervals
- ✅ Callback system (onComplete, onWarning, onCritical, onTick)
- ✅ Pause/resume functionality
- ✅ Visual update with percentage-based honey level
- ✅ Web Audio API buzz sound (gentle 180Hz sawtooth wave)
- ✅ Automatic state management (warning/critical/expired)

**Methods:**
```javascript
start()         // Start countdown from full duration
pause()         // Pause without resetting
resume()        // Resume from paused state
stop()          // Stop and clear interval
reset()         // Reset to initial state
hide()          // Fade out with animation
destroy()       // Complete cleanup
updateDisplay() // Update honey level and number
```

### 3. QuizManager Integration
**Location:** `templates/quiz.html` lines 2328-2340, 2951-3056

**Timer Settings:**
```javascript
this.timerEnabled = true;           // Toggle on/off
this.timerDuration = 15;            // Default 15 seconds
this.timerMode = 'normal';          // 'easy', 'normal', 'challenge', 'dynamic'
this.timerStrictMode = false;       // Soft mode (no auto-submit)
this.countdownTimer = null;         // Timer instance
```

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ `loadNextWordWithIntro()` - Starts timer when word appears

### 4. Timer Duration Modes

#### Normal Mode (Default)
- **Easy**: 20 seconds per word
- **Normal**: 15 seconds per word ✓ DEFAULT
- **Challenge**: 10 seconds per word

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

### CSS Media Query
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .jar-outline {
        width: 65px;      /* Smaller jar */
        height: 85px;
    }
    
    .timer-number {
        font-size: 1.6rem; /* Smaller number */
    }
}
```

### Touch Friendly

- ✅ Gentle sounds (not startling)

### Future Enhancements (TODO)
- [ ] Screen reader announcements at 10s, 5s, 3s
- [ ] ARIA live region for timer updates
- [ ] Option to disable timer completely
- [ ] Option to disable sound
- [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for pulse animations

## 🐝 Kid-Friendly Design Decisions

### Why Soft Mode Default?
1. **No stress**: Kids can take their time
2. **Learning focus**: Emphasis on correct spelling, not speed
3. **Positive experience**: Timer adds excitement without pressure
4. **Teacher control**: Can switch to strict mode for challenges

### Why 15 Seconds?
1. **Not too fast**: Gives time to think and spell carefully
2. **Not too slow**: Keeps engagement and prevents daydreaming
3. **Goldilocks zone**: Based on average 6-8 letter word spelling time
4. **Adjustable**: Can use dynamic mode for varied difficulty

### Why Honey Jar Visual?
1. **Thematic**: Matches BeeSmart bee theme perfectly
2. **Intuitive**: Draining = time passing (clear metaphor)
3. **Beautiful**: Kids love the golden shimmer and bubbles
4. **Non-threatening**: Honey is sweet and friendly, not scary

### Phase 3: Battle Mode Integration
