## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No badges showing?
**Check**: User has achievements in database
```python
from models import User, Achievement
user = User.query.filter_by(username='BigDaddy').first()
badges = Achievement.query.filter_by(user_id=user.id).all()
print(f"Found {len(badges)} badges")
```

### CSS not applying?
**Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Template error?
**Check**: Flask server restarted after code changes
