# üêù BeeSmart Deployment Checklist

## Recent Updates

### ‚úÖ Avatar Database Fix (October 20, 2025)
**Issue**: BigDaddy2 account showed "Cool Bee" instead of "Professor Bee"  
**Root Cause**: Database had `avatar_id = 'cool-bee'` instead of `'professor-bee'`  
**Fix Applied**: Updated Railway PostgreSQL database directly  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Database now shows `professor-bee` (updated: 2025-10-21 02:26:05)

**Verification Command**:
```python
python check_railway_bigdaddy_avatar.py
# Expected: Avatar ID: professor-bee
```

**User Action**: Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)

‚úÖ Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!
```

**Should NOT see:**
```
‚ùå Error loading MTL materials
Fallback 3D bee added (OBJ not available)
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Network Tab Check
Browser Dev Tools ‚Üí Network tab

**Filter by:** "model" or "texture"

**Should see (Status 200):**

## Railway Deployment Monitor

Check deployment status:
1. Go to: `https://railway.app/dashboard`
2. Select your BeeSmartSpellingBeeApp project
3. Watch the deployment logs
4. Wait for "‚úÖ Deployment successful" message

**Typical deployment time:** 2-5 minutes

## If Issues Occur

### Yellow Sphere Still Appears
1. Check console for error messages
2. Copy full error from console
3. Check Network tab for 404s
4. Share console logs for debugging

### Files Not Found (404)
- Verify files exist: `/static/assets/avatars/{avatar-id}/model.obj`
- Check if Railway deployed static files correctly
- May need to verify static file serving in Railway settings

### No 3D Model at All
1. Check if Three.js loaded: Type `THREE` in console
2. Check if loaders available: Type `THREE.OBJLoader` in console
3. Verify WebGL support in browser
4. Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Fix is successful when:**
- All avatars load with proper 3D models (no yellow spheres)
- Console shows successful loading messages
- Network tab shows all files loading (200 status)
- 3D models have correct colors and textures
- Models rotate and animate smoothly

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If critical issues occur:
```powershell
git revert 559f2cd
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically deploy the previous version.
