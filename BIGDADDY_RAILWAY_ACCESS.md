## 🔐 Database Sync

### How Your Account Works on Railway

**Local Development:**
- Database file: `beesmart.db` (in your project folder)
- Contains 21 users including BigDaddy

**Railway Production:**
- Uses the same `beesmart.db` structure
- **If using persistent volume:** Same database, same users ✅
- **If fresh database:** Need to create user again

## 🛠️ If BigDaddy Doesn't Exist on Railway

If you get "Invalid credentials" on Railway, it means the Railway database is fresh. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Quick Create (Recommended)

**SSH into Railway and run:**

```bash
# Connect to Railway
railway shell

# Create admin user
python3 << 'EOF'
from AjaSpellBApp import app, db
from models import User
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
import uuid

with app.app_context():
    # Check if user exists
    existing = User.query.filter_by(username='BigDaddy').first()
    if existing:
        print("✅ BigDaddy already exists!")
    else:
        # Create admin user
        admin = User(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            username='BigDaddy',
            display_name='Big Daddy',
            email='bigdaddy@beesmart.app',
            password_hash=generate_password_hash('Aja121514!'),
            role='admin',
            email_verified=True
        )
        db.session.add(admin)
        db.session.commit()
        print("✅ BigDaddy admin user created!")
EOF
```

### Option 2: Use Existing Script

**Upload and run your script:**

```bash
# In Railway shell
railway run python create_admin_bigdaddy.py
```

### Option 3: Copy Local Database to Railway

**Upload your local database:**

1. Ensure Railway has persistent volume configured
2. Upload `beesmart.db` to Railway's data directory
3. Restart Railway service

## 🔄 Railway Database Persistence

### Current Railway Configuration

**Check your `railway.toml`:**

```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"

[deploy]
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 300
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Database Storage Options:

1. **Ephemeral (Default):**
   - Database resets on each deployment
   - Need to recreate users after every deploy
   - Not recommended for production

2. **Persistent Volume (Recommended):**
   - Database persists across deployments
   - Users remain after updates
   - Add volume in Railway dashboard

### To Add Persistent Volume:

1. Go to Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" or "Data" tab
4. Add volume mount: `/app/beesmart.db`
5. Redeploy service
