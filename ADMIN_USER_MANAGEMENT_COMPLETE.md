All stat cards on the admin dashboard are now interactive:
- **My Students/Family** → Scrolls to student list on same page
- **Total Users** → Opens full user management page (`/admin/users`)
- **Students** → Opens user management filtered by students
- **Teachers** → Opens user management filtered by teachers
- **Quizzes & Words** → Display-only stats

**Visual Feedback:**
- Hover effects with lift animation
- Clear "Click to view" hints
- Smooth transitions
