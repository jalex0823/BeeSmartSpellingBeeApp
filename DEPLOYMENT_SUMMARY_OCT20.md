## 📦 Changes Deployed

### 1. ✅ Professor Bee Avatar Fix
**Issue**: BigDaddy2 was seeing Cool Bee instead of Professor Bee  
**Fix**: Updated Railway PostgreSQL database directly  
**Result**: Avatar now correctly shows Professor Bee (professor-bee)

**Database Update**:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET avatar_id = 'professor-bee', 
    avatar_last_updated = NOW()
WHERE username = 'BigDaddy2';
-- Updated: 2025-10-21 02:26:05
```

### 2. ✅ Admin Dashboard Student Query Fix
**Issue**: Students not appearing in "My Students/Family" section  
**Fix**: Updated query to use `TeacherStudent` link table instead of comparing `teacher_key` fields  
**Result**: All linked students now appear in admin dashboard

**Code Change** (`AjaSpellBApp.py` line ~5730):
```python
# OLD: User.query.filter(User.teacher_key == my_key)
# NEW: Uses TeacherStudent link table properly
student_links = TeacherStudent.query.filter_by(
    teacher_key=my_key,
    is_active=True
).all()
```

### 3. ✅ Registration Flow Fix
**Issue**: Students couldn't register with admin keys (UNIQUE constraint violation)  
**Fix**: Removed `teacher_key` from student User records, only create TeacherStudent links  
**Result**: Multiple students can now register with same admin key

**Code Changes** (`AjaSpellBApp.py` line ~4455):
- Removed `teacher_key` from User creation for students
- Enhanced TeacherStudent link creation with error handling
- Added confirmation message: "You've been linked to [Admin]'s dashboard!"

### 4. ✅ Dictionary Voice Visualizer UI
**Issue**: Voice visualizer appeared above definition (awkward position)  
**Fix**: Moved visualizer below definition and example  
**Result**: Better visual hierarchy - users see content first, then animation

**Layout Change** (`templates/unified_menu.html`):
```
OLD: Title → Visualizer → Button → Definition
NEW: Title → Button → Definition → Visualizer
```

### 5. ✅ Registration Form UI Improvements
**Issue**: "Teacher Key" label was confusing for parents  
**Fix**: Updated to "Parent/Teacher Key" with clearer help text  
**Result**: Better user understanding of the feature

**UI Updates** (`templates/auth/register.html`):
- Label: "Teacher Key" → "Parent/Teacher Key"
- Help text now explains dashboard tracking purpose
- Uses BigDaddy2's actual key as example

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Hard Refresh Needed for Avatar
**Symptom**: Professor Bee doesn't show immediately after DB update

**Solution**: This is NOW FIXED by using proper link table query  
**Verify**: Check Railway logs for "✅ Linked [student] to [admin]'s dashboard"

### Issue: Registration Fails with UNIQUE Constraint
