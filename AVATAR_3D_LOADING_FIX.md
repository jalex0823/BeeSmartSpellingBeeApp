# Avatar 3D Loading Fix - October 20, 2025

## Problem Identified

The 3D avatars were failing to load properly, showing only a yellow sphere (fallback) instead of the actual bee models. This happened regardless of which avatar was selected.

## Root Cause

The `mascot-3d.js` file had issues handling **absolute paths** for avatar files. When the `user-avatar-loader.js` passed absolute paths like `/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.obj`, the loading logic was not properly extracting the base directory and filename.

## Files Modified

### 1. `static/js/mascot-3d.js` (Primary Fix)
**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Added logic to detect absolute vs relative paths
- ✅ Properly extracts base directory from absolute paths
- ✅ Enhanced console logging for better debugging
- ✅ Improved error messages with detailed path information
- ✅ Better fallback handling with texture loading

**Key Improvements:**
```javascript
// Now handles both:
// Absolute: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl
// Relative: MascotBee_1019174653_texture.mtl
```

### 2. `AjaSpellBApp.py`
- ✅ Added `send_from_directory` to Flask imports
- ✅ Added `/test/avatar-loading` route for diagnostics

### 3. `test_avatar_loading.html` (NEW)
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostic page
- ✅ Tests file accessibility
- ✅ Tests Three.js loaders
- ✅ Live 3D avatar loading test
- ✅ Buttons to test different avatars

## Avatar File Structure

The app uses TWO locations for avatar files:

### Location 1: `/static/assets/avatars/{avatar-id}/`
**Structure:**
```
/static/assets/avatars/
├── cool-bee/
│   ├── model.obj
│   ├── model.mtl
│   ├── texture.png
│   ├── thumbnail.png
│   └── preview.png
├── explorer-bee/
├── doctor-bee/
... (and others)
```

**MTL File Content:**
```mtl
# References texture.png (relative path)
map_Kd texture.png
```

### Location 2: `/static/3DFiles/Avatars/`  
**Legacy structure with full filenames:**
```
/static/3DFiles/Avatars/
├── Cool_Bee_1019092438_texture.obj
├── Cool_Bee_1019092438_texture.mtl
├── Cool_Bee_1019092438_texture.png
... (and others)
```

## How the Fix Works

### Before (BROKEN):
1. API returns: `/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl`
2. `mascot-3d.js` used `modelBase` path incorrectly
3. Tried to load from wrong location
4. MTL loader failed
5. Fallback to yellow sphere

### After (FIXED):
1. API returns: `/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl`
2. `mascot-3d.js` detects absolute path
3. Extracts base: `/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/`
4. Extracts filename: `model.mtl`
5. Sets MTL loader path to base
6. Sets resource path for textures to base
7. Successfully loads MTL → OBJ → Texture
8. **Bee renders correctly!**

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Diagnostic Page
1. Open your browser developer console (F12)
2. Navigate to: `https://beesmartspellingbee.up.railway.app/test/avatar-loading`
3. Check the file accessibility tests (should all show ✅)
4. Click "Load Cool Bee" button
5. Watch the 3D model load and rotate

### Test 2: Admin Dashboard
1. Log in as admin
2. Go to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Your avatar should load in the profile card (top right)
4. Check console for detailed loading logs:
   ```
   🐝 Loading 3D model from: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/
      MTL: model.mtl
      OBJ: model.obj
      Texture: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/texture.png
   ✅ MTL materials loaded successfully
   ✅ Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!
   ```

### Test 3: Avatar Selection
1. Go to `/test/avatar-picker`
2. Select different avatars
3. Each should load with proper textures
4. No yellow spheres!

## Console Logging (Enhanced)

The fix adds comprehensive logging to help diagnose issues:

```javascript
🐝 Loading 3D model from: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/
   MTL: model.mtl
   OBJ: model.obj
   Texture: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/texture.png
✅ MTL materials loaded successfully
Loading materials: 100%
Loading model: 100%
✅ Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!
```

If errors occur:
```javascript
❌ Error loading MTL materials: [error details]
   MTL path attempted: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl
   Full MTL path: /static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl
   Error type: unknown
   Error message: [details]
⚠️ Attempting fallback load without MTL
```

## Fallback Chain

The system now has a 3-level fallback:

1. **Primary**: Load OBJ with MTL materials (full textures)
2. **Fallback 1**: Load OBJ with manual texture (if MTL fails)
3. **Fallback 2**: Show yellow sphere (if everything fails)
4. **Fallback 3**: Show 2D bee emoji 🐝 (if WebGL fails)

## What to Watch For

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Console shows "✅ MTL materials loaded successfully"
- Console shows "✅ Mascot Bee 3D model loaded successfully with textures!"
- 3D bee model visible (not yellow sphere)
- Bee has proper colors/textures
- Bee rotates smoothly

### ❌ Failure Indicators:
- Yellow sphere appears
- Console shows "❌ Error loading MTL materials"
- Console shows "Fallback 3D bee added"
- 404 errors in Network tab

## Network Tab Check

Open browser Dev Tools → Network tab and filter by "3D" or "model":

**Should see:**
- `model.mtl` - Status 200 ✅
- `model.obj` - Status 200 ✅
- `texture.png` - Status 200 ✅

**Should NOT see:**
- Any 404 errors
- Failed requests to `/static/models/` (old path)

## API Response Format

The `/api/users/me/avatar` endpoint returns:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "avatar": {
    "avatar_id": "cool-bee",
    "variant": "default",
    "name": "Cool Bee",
    "urls": {
      "model_obj": "/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.obj",
      "model_mtl": "/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/model.mtl",
      "texture": "/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/texture.png",
      "thumbnail": "/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/thumbnail.png",
      "preview": "/static/assets/avatars/cool-bee/preview.png",
      "fallback": null
    }
  },
  "use_mascot": false
}
```

## Compatibility

This fix ensures compatibility with:
- ✅ User-selected avatars (from avatar picker)
- ✅ Default MascotBee (for users without selection)
- ✅ Admin dashboard avatars
- ✅ Quiz page avatars
- ✅ Profile page avatars
- ✅ All 16 avatar types in catalog

## Next Steps

1. **Test the diagnostic page**: `/test/avatar-loading`
2. **Check the admin dashboard**: Verify your avatar loads
3. **Test avatar selection**: Try changing avatars
4. **Monitor console logs**: Look for the enhanced logging
5. **Report any issues**: Share console logs if problems persist

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, the fallback system ensures users still see something:
1. Yellow sphere (3D fallback)
2. 2D bee emoji 🐝
3. Static bee image

The app remains functional even if 3D fails.
