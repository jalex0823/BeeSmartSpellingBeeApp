## 👦 Student Workflow

### Step 1: Join Battle (NAME REQUIRED)
```
1. Student opens BeeSmart app
2. Clicks "⚔️ Battle of the Bees"
3. Selects "Join the Battle" tab
4. Sees form:

   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Battle Code:                     │
   │ ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │
   │ │ BATTLE123                    │ │
   │ └──────────────────────────────┘ │
   │                                  │
   │ Your Name: ⭐ REQUIRED           │
   │ ┌──────────────────────────────┐ │
   │ │ Alice                        │ │
   │ └──────────────────────────────┘ │
   │                                  │
   │      [⚡ Join Battle!]           │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘

5. Student MUST enter:
   ✅ Battle code (from teacher)
   ✅ Their name (any name they want)

6. System validates:
   ❌ Blank name → Error: "Please enter your name!"
   ❌ Duplicate name → Error: "A player named 'Alice' has already joined. Please use a different name."
   ✅ Unique name → Success!
```

### Step 2: Name Validation
System ensures:
- ✅ **Name cannot be blank** - Students MUST enter something
- ✅ **Names must be unique** - No two "Alice" in same battle
- ✅ **Case-insensitive check** - "alice" = "Alice" = "ALICE"
- ✅ **Permanent once joined** - Name locked in, can't change mid-battle

### Step 3: Start Spelling
```
After joining successfully:
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚔️ Welcome, Alice!                   │
│ You've joined "Spelling Test Week 12"│
│ 👥 12 players in battle              │
│ 📚 15 words to spell                 │

│ [👀 View Leaderboard]                │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 📊 Grading Examples

### Example 1: Score-Based Grading
```
Total Possible: 1500 points (15 words × 100 base points)

Alice:   950 pts  → 63% → D  (but 100% accuracy!)
Bob:     850 pts  → 57% → F
Charlie: 720 pts  → 48% → F

Note: Students who spell correctly but slowly get lower scores
→ Consider using Accuracy % instead for fairer grading
```

### Example 2: Accuracy-Based Grading (RECOMMENDED)
```
Alice:   100% → A+
Bob:     93%  → A
Charlie: 87%  → B+
David:   80%  → B
Emma:    73%  → C

This rewards correct spelling regardless of speed
```

### Example 3: Completion-Based
```
✅ Completed all 15 words → 100%
✅ Completed 10+ words   → 75%
⏸️ Incomplete            → 0% (or mark as missing)
```

## 📝 Student Name Best Practices

### For Teachers:
1. **Tell students to use REAL NAMES**
   - "Enter your first and last name: John Smith"
   - Easier for grading

2. **Or use student IDs**
   - "Enter your student ID: JS12345"
   - Better for privacy

3. **Set naming convention**
   - "FirstName LastInitial" → "Alice J"
   - Consistent format for your gradebook

### For Students:
1. **Use the name teacher expects**
   - If teacher calls you "Robert", use "Robert" not "Bobby"

2. **Check spelling of your own name**
   - "Alise" vs "Alice" creates duplicate entry

3. **Don't use nicknames unless told**
   - Teacher might not recognize "The Spelling Wizard"

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Student says they can't join"
**Solution:** Check if:
- ✅ Battle code is correct (case-insensitive but spelling matters)
- ✅ Battle hasn't expired (24-hour limit)
- ✅ They entered a name
- ✅ Name isn't already taken

### Issue 2: "I don't see student's name on leaderboard"
**Solution:**
- ✅ Click "🔄 Refresh Now" button
- ✅ Check if student actually clicked "Join Battle"
- ✅ Confirm they entered correct battle code
- ✅ Auto-refresh is every 5 seconds

### Issue 3: "Student entered wrong name"
**Solution:**
- ❌ **Can't change name after joining**
- ✅ Student must join again with new name
- ✅ Teacher can ignore the wrong entry in export

### Issue 4: "Two students have same name"
**Solution:**
- ✅ System prevents this automatically
- ✅ Second student must add last initial or number
- ✅ Example: "Alice" → "Alice S" or "Alice 2"
