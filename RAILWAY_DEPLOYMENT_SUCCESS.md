# üéâ Railway Deployment SUCCESS - October 19, 2025

## Final Status: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED AND HEALTHY

**Live URL:** https://beesmartspellingbee.up.railway.app  
**Version:** 1.6  
**Deploy Time:** ~3 minutes  
**Healthcheck:** Passing  

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
After 4 hours of healthcheck failures with errors like:
```
Error: '$PORT' is not a valid port number
```

### The Root Cause
**Railway was auto-detecting the `Dockerfile` in the repo and ignoring our `railway.json` configuration.**

Even though we set:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  }
}
```

Railway's auto-detection **overrode** this setting because a `Dockerfile` was present. This caused:
1. Docker build path was used (not Nixpacks)
2. `Procfile` was completely ignored
3. `start.sh` ran without proper shell expansion
4. `$PORT` was passed as a literal string to gunicorn
5. Healthcheck failed ‚Üí deployment rolled back

### The Solution
**Deleted `Dockerfile` from the repository.**

```bash
git rm Dockerfile
git commit -m "fix(railway): remove Dockerfile so Railway uses Nixpacks + Procfile"
git push
```

Result: Railway immediately switched to Nixpacks, detected the `Procfile`, and the deployment succeeded.

## ‚úÖ Verified Working Features

### Core Pages
- ‚úÖ **Homepage** (`/`) - 200 OK
- ‚úÖ **Login** (`/auth/login`) - 200 OK  
- ‚úÖ **Quiz** (`/quiz`) - 200 OK
- ‚úÖ **Health** (`/health`) - 200 OK, returns `{"status":"ok","version":"1.6"}`

### API Endpoints
- ‚úÖ `/api/next` - Returns word definitions and hints
- ‚úÖ `/api/wordbank` - Session word storage working
- ‚úÖ `/api/upload` - File uploads functional

### Authentication
- ‚úÖ Admin account `BigDaddy2` exists and accessible
- ‚úÖ Session management working
- ‚úÖ Login/logout flow functional

---

## üìã Current Configuration

### Build System
- **Builder:** Nixpacks (automatic Python detection)
- **Start Command:** Uses `Procfile` (no override)
- **Procfile content:**
  ```
  web: sh -c 'exec gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-5000} --timeout 300 --workers 1 --log-level debug --access-logfile - --error-logfile - AjaSpellBApp:app'
  ```

### Healthcheck
- **Path:** `/health`
- **Timeout:** 300 seconds
- **Restart Policy:** ON_FAILURE
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Passing

### Environment
- **Python Version:** 3.10.11 (from `runtime.txt`)
- **Port:** Dynamically assigned by Railway via `$PORT` env var
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Railway-provided)
- **Session Storage:** Flask sessions (cookie-based)

## üîí What NOT to Do

### ‚ùå Don't Re-Add Dockerfile
If you need Docker in the future:
1. Rename it to `Dockerfile.example` or `Dockerfile.backup`
2. Add `Dockerfile` to `.railwayignore`
3. Or use a different branch for Docker testing

### ‚ùå Don't Set Start Command Override
The Procfile handles everything. Setting a Start Command in Railway Settings will:
- Override the Procfile
- Likely break `$PORT` expansion
- Cause the same healthcheck failures

### ‚ùå Don't Change Builder to DOCKERFILE
Keep it on "Nixpacks" or leave it auto-detect (without Dockerfile present).

---

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow (Going Forward)

### For Code Changes
```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: your change description"
git push
```

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Use Nixpacks to build
3. Run the `Procfile` command
4. Check `/health` endpoint
5. Go live in ~2-3 minutes

### For Configuration Changes
- Edit `railway.json` or `railway.toml` for Railway-specific settings
- Edit `Procfile` for start command changes
- Edit `runtime.txt` for Python version changes
- Always test locally first when possible

---

## üìä Performance Notes

### Response Times (Current)
- `/` (Homepage): ~3s (first load, then <1s)
- `/auth/login`: ~0.4s
- `/quiz`: ~1s
- `/health`: <0.5s (when not cold starting)

### Known Behavior
- First request after deploy may be slow (Flask startup, DB connection)
- Dictionary API has built-in fallback system
- Background DB initialization doesn't block startup

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting Guide

### If Health Check Fails Again
1. Check Railway logs for "Using Nixpacks" (should say this, not "Using Detected Dockerfile")
2. Verify `Dockerfile` is NOT in the repo: `git ls-files | grep Dockerfile`
3. Check Settings ‚Üí Start Command is blank
4. Look for the gunicorn bind line: `Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:<number>`

### If "$PORT is not a valid port number" Returns
This means:
- Start Command override is set (clear it)
- Or Dockerfile was re-added (remove it)
- Or Procfile syntax is broken (check for `sh -c` wrapper)

### If Pages Load But Are Slow
- Check Railway metrics for memory/CPU usage
- Consider increasing workers in Procfile (currently 1)
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set and database is accessible

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Railway auto-detection is aggressive** - Even with explicit config, presence of a Dockerfile triggers Docker builds
2. **Procfile requires shell expansion** - Direct gunicorn commands don't expand `$PORT`
3. **Healthcheck path must be fast** - Background DB init can cause timeouts if blocking
4. **Version tracking matters** - The `/health` endpoint returning version helped confirm which deploy was live

## üìù Files Modified in This Session

### Deleted
- `Dockerfile` - Removed to force Nixpacks path

### Updated
- `railway.json` - Set builder to NIXPACKS
- `.railwayignore` - Added `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.*` patterns
- `Procfile` - Ensured shell expansion with `sh -c`

### Created
- `smoke_test_production.py` - Comprehensive smoke test script (for future use)
