## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Session Management
```python
# Hybrid storage pattern
- Small metadata: Flask session cookies
- Large data: Server-side WORD_STORAGE dict
- UUID-based lookups for word lists
- Helper functions: get_wordbank(), set_wordbank()
```

### Dictionary System
```python
# 3-tier fallback
1. Cache (dictionary.json) - Instant lookup
2. API (dictionary_api.py) - Rate-limited requests
3. Fallback (pattern-based) - Smart guessing for common patterns
```

### File Processing Pipeline
```python
Upload → Parse → Normalize → Deduplicate → Enrich → Store → Initialize Quiz
```

### Speech System
```javascript
// Promise-based with error handling
cleanTextForSpeech() → speakAnnouncement() → await completion → next word
```
