# 🔒 Acronym Filter Implementation

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Overview
Enhanced the kid-friendly word filter to block acronyms from being used in spelling quizzes, ensuring students only practice spelling real words.

---

## ✅ What Was Added

### Acronym Detection Rules

The filter now blocks words that are likely acronyms using multiple detection methods:

#### 1. **All-Caps Detection**
- Blocks words written in ALL CAPITALS (e.g., NASA, FBI, HTML)
- **Exception:** Allows common words like OK, US, AM, PM, AD, BC, TV

#### 2. **No-Vowel Detection** 
- Blocks short words (2-4 letters) with NO vowels
- Common acronyms like: BRB, FYI, BTW, DVD, LCD
- **Exception:** Allows words like: by, my, try, gym, sky

#### 3. **Mixed-Case Detection**
- Blocks words with capital letters in the middle (e.g., iPhone, YouTube, iPad)
- These are typically brand names or product names
- Not appropriate for spelling practice

---

## 🎯 Examples

### ✅ ALLOWED (Real Words)
```
hello, world, beautiful, the, try, sky, gym, word, work, book
OK, US, AM, PM  (common abbreviations)
```

### ❌ BLOCKED (Acronyms)
```
NASA, FBI, CIA, HTML, HTTP, DVD, GPS, LCD, WWE, NFL
BRB, FYI, BTW, ASAP, LOL, OMG
iPhone, YouTube, iPad, MacBook
```

## 📊 Filter Statistics

### Test Results:
- **31/31 tests passed** (100% accuracy)
- **Real words:** All properly allowed
- **Acronyms:** All properly blocked
- **Brand names:** All properly blocked
- **Inappropriate words:** All properly blocked

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Location
**File:** `AjaSpellBApp.py`  
**Function:** `is_kid_friendly(word: str) -> tuple[bool, str]`  
**Lines:** ~912-980

### Filter Logic

```python
# 1. Check all-caps (except allowed words)
if original_word.isupper() and len(original_word) >= 2:
    allowed_caps_words = {'TV', 'OK', 'US', 'AM', 'PM', 'AD', 'BC'}
    if original_word not in allowed_caps_words:
        return False, "appears to be an acronym (all capitals)"

# 2. Check for no vowels in short words
if len(word_lower) >= 2 and len(word_lower) <= 4:
    vowels = sum(1 for c in word_lower if c in 'aeiou')
    if vowels == 0:
        allowed_no_vowel = {'by', 'my', 'try', 'gym', 'sky', ...}
        if word_lower not in allowed_no_vowel:
            return False, "appears to be an acronym (no vowels)"

# 3. Check for mixed-case (brand names)
if any(c.isupper() for c in original_word[1:]):
    return False, "unusual capitalization (possibly acronym or brand name)"
```

## 🚀 Where It's Applied

The `is_kid_friendly()` filter is applied at **3 critical points**:

### 1. **File Upload** (`/api/upload`)
- Filters words from CSV, TXT, DOCX, PDF uploads
- **Lines:** 2743-2767

### 2. **Enhanced Upload** (`/api/upload-enhanced`)
- Filters during background processing
- **Lines:** 2949-2971

### 3. **OCR Image Upload** (`/api/upload-ocr`)
- Filters words extracted from images
- **Lines:** 3140-3160

---

## 📝 User Experience

### Upload Flow:

1. **User uploads word list** → `spelling_words.txt`
   ```
   hello
   NASA
   world
   iPhone
   beautiful
   FBI
   ```

2. **Filter processes words:**
   - ✅ hello → Accepted
   - ❌ NASA → Blocked (all capitals)
   - ✅ world → Accepted
   - ❌ iPhone → Blocked (mixed case)
   - ✅ beautiful → Accepted
   - ❌ FBI → Blocked (all capitals)

3. **User sees results:**
   ```
   ✅ 3 words accepted
   ⚠️ 3 words blocked as acronyms/inappropriate
   
   Blocked: NASA, iPhone, FBI
   ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Dictionary Integration:** Cross-check against English dictionary
2. **Machine Learning:** Train model to detect acronyms more accurately
3. **Custom Whitelist:** Let teachers add approved acronyms for specific lessons
4. **Analytics:** Track most commonly blocked acronyms

### Not Implemented (By Design):
- ❌ Blocking all 3-letter words (too restrictive)
- ❌ Requiring minimum vowel count (blocks valid words)
- ❌ Blocking all caps input (users can type however)
