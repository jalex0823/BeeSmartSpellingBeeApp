## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. HTML Changes

**Added Caption Element:**
```html
<div id="mascotCaption" style="
    font-size: 14px;
    color: #FF6B00;
    font-weight: 600;
    margin-top: -5px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    text-align: center;
    animation: gentlePulse 2s ease-in-out infinite;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
" onclick="playMascotShow()">
    ✨ Click on me to see what I do! ✨
</div>
```

**Made Mascot Clickable:**
```html
<div id="mascotBee3D" 
     style="cursor: pointer;" 
     onclick="playMascotShow()" 
     title="Click me to see what I do!">
</div>
```

### 2. CSS Changes

**Hover Effects:**
```css
#mascotBee3D:hover {
    transform: translateY(-15px) scale(1.05);
}

#mascotCaption:hover {
    color: #FFB347;
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

**Gentle Pulse Animation:**
```css
@keyframes gentlePulse {
    0%, 100% {
        opacity: 0.8;
        transform: scale(1);
    }
    50% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1.05);
    }
}
```

### 3. JavaScript Functions Added

#### Main Show Controller
```javascript
function playMascotShow() {
    // Randomly selects one of 5 animations
    // Hides caption during show
    // Plays corresponding sound
    // Restores caption after completion
}
```

#### Animation Functions
- `performSpin(mascot)` - Spinning animation
- `performBounce(mascot)` - Bouncing animation
- `performFly(mascot)` - Flying animation
- `performExplosion(mascot)` - Explosion with particles
- `performDance(mascot)` - Dance routine

#### Sound System
```javascript
function playMascotSound(animationType) {
    // Creates Web Audio Context
    // Plays frequency-based sound effects
    // Different note patterns for each animation
    // iOS-compatible with context resume
}
```

#### Particle System
```javascript
function createExplosionParticles(mascot) {
    // Spawns 30 emoji particles
    // Radiates in circular pattern
    // Animates with rotation and fade
    // Auto-cleanup after 1.5 seconds
}
```

### 4. Animation Keyframes

All animations use CSS keyframes for smooth performance:
- `@keyframes mascotSpin` - 720° rotation with scaling
- `@keyframes mascotBounce` - Vertical bouncing
- `@keyframes mascotFly` - Figure-8 flight path
- `@keyframes mascotShake` - Horizontal shake for explosion
- `@keyframes mascotDance` - Complex multi-step dance

## 🏃 Speed Round Fix

### Previous Behavior
```javascript
// WRONG: Was redirecting to regular quiz with mode parameter
window.location.href = '/quiz?mode=speed';
```

### Fixed Behavior

window.location.href = '/speed-round/setup';
```

### Speed Round Flow (Restored)
1. User clicks "Speed Round Challenge" button
2. Modal appears with speed round info
3. User clicks "Start Speed Round!"
4. **NEW:** Navigates to `/speed-round/setup` (dedicated page)
