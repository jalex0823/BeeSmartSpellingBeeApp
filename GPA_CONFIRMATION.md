---

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Quiz 1 Completed → Grade: A- (GPA: 3.7) → Saved to database
                ↓
        System calculates: Cumulative GPA = 3.7
                ↓
        Dashboard shows: GPA: 3.70

Quiz 2 Completed → Grade: B (GPA: 3.0) → Saved to database
                ↓
        System recalculates from BOTH quizzes:
        (3.7 + 3.0) / 2 = 3.35
                ↓
        Dashboard shows: GPA: 3.35

Quiz 3 Completed → Grade: A+ (GPA: 4.0) → Saved to database
                ↓
        System recalculates from ALL 3 quizzes:
        (3.7 + 3.0 + 4.0) / 3 = 3.57
                ↓
        Dashboard shows: GPA: 3.57

...and so on for EVERY quiz you complete!

## 📊 What Gets Accumulated

| Stat | How It's Calculated | Example |
|------|---------------------|---------|
| **Cumulative GPA** | Average of ALL quiz grades converted to 4.0 scale | Quiz 1: A- (3.7), Quiz 2: B (3.0) → GPA = 3.35 |
| **Average Accuracy** | Average accuracy % from ALL quizzes | Quiz 1: 90%, Quiz 2: 85% → Avg = 87.5% |
| **Best Grade** | Highest letter grade from ALL quizzes | Quizzes: B, A-, B+, A+ → Best = A+ |
| **Best Streak** | Longest streak from ALL quizzes | Streaks: 5, 12, 8 → Best = 12 |
| **Total Quizzes** | Count of ALL completed quizzes | 1, 2, 3, 4... |
| **Total Points** | Sum of points from ALL quizzes | 500 + 850 + 1200 = 2550 |

### After 3rd Quiz:

## 🎯 The Key Code

**File: `models.py` (Line 84-136)**

```python
def update_gpa_and_accuracy(self):
    # Query ALL completed quizzes for this user
    completed_sessions = QuizSession.query.filter_by(
        user_id=self.id,
        completed=True
    ).all()  # ← Gets EVERY quiz you've ever completed
    
    # Loop through EVERY quiz
    for session in completed_sessions:
        total_gpa_points += grade_to_gpa[session.grade]
        total_accuracy += session.accuracy_percentage
    
    # Calculate cumulative average from ALL quizzes
    self.cumulative_gpa = total_gpa_points / len(completed_sessions)
    self.average_accuracy = total_accuracy / len(completed_sessions)
```

**This runs automatically after EVERY quiz completion!**
