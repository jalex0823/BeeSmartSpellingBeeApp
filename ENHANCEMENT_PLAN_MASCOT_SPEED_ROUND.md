## ðŸ“‹ DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION

### Task 1: Mascot Interactive Show
**File:** `templates/unified_menu.html`

**Function to implement:**
```javascript
function playMascotShow() {
    // 1. Get mascot bee 3D object
    // 2. Play series of animations:
    //    - Spin rapidly (360Â° rotation)
    //    - Bounce up and down
    //    - Fly in figure-8 pattern
    //    - Return to original position
    // 3. Play sounds:
    //    - Buzzing sounds
    //    - Musical notes
    //    - Explosion/firework sounds
    // 4. Add particle effects (sparkles, stars, confetti)
    // 5. All effects should be random and fun!
}
```

**Features:**
- âœ¨ Random animations each time clicked
- ðŸŽµ Fun sound effects
- ðŸ’¥ Visual particle explosions
- ðŸ”„ Different sequences each time

### Task 2: Speed Round Enhancements

#### A. Database Schema Check
**File:** `models.py`

Current `SpeedRoundScore` model includes:
- âœ… `user_id` (linked to User)
- âœ… `honey_points_earned`
- âœ… `words_correct`, `words_attempted`
- âœ… `accuracy_percentage` property
- âœ… Relationship to User model

**NEEDED:** Integration with User GPA/Grade calculation

#### B. Add Introduction Modal
**File:** `templates/speed_round_setup.html` OR create new flow

**Introduction Content:**
```
ðŸš€ SPEED ROUND CHALLENGE ðŸš€

Ready to test your spelling speed?

How it works:
â€¢ You'll spell words as fast as you can!
â€¢ Each word has a timer - beat the clock!
â€¢ I'll announce each word before the timer starts
â€¢ Earn bonus points for speed and accuracy!
â€¢ Your score counts toward your overall grade

Are you ready to buzz through some words?
```

#### C. Word Announcement Before Timer
**File:** `templates/speed_round_quiz.html`

**Flow:**
1. Announcer says: "Your word is: [WORD]"
2. Wait for speech to finish
3. Show word on screen
4. START timer countdown
5. Student types answer
6. Check answer and move to next

#### D. Score Integration with User Profile
**Files to modify:**
- `AjaSpellBApp.py` - Speed round save endpoint
- `models.py` - User model GPA calculation

**Changes needed:**
```python
# In User model
def calculate_gpa(self):
    """Calculate GPA including quiz AND speed round scores"""
    # Include speed_round_scores in calculation
    # Weight: 40% quiz scores, 30% speed round, 30% battle mode
    pass
```

### Task 3: Registration Page Thumbnails

**File:** `templates/auth/register.html`

**Current issue:** Thumbnails too narrow for avatar names

**Solution:**
```css
.avatar-thumbnail {
    width: 140px;  /* Increased from 100px */
    height: 160px; /* Increased to accommodate name */
    /* Name at bottom with 20px padding */
}

.avatar-name {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 5px;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 11px;
    font-weight: 600;
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
    padding: 4px 2px;
    border-radius: 0 0 8px 8px;
}
```
