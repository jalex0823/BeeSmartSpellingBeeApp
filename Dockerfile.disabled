# Dockerfile temporarily disabled to use Procfile/Nixpacks on Railway
# Rename back to "Dockerfile" to re-enable Docker-based deployments.

# Previous content retained in git history; this placeholder prevents Railway
# from using the Dockerfile path so we can return to the last-known-good Procfile flow.
