## 💡 Testing Tips

### 1. Use Headphones/Speakers
Clear audio helps verify announcement sequence

### 2. Watch Console (F12)
Look for timer logs:
```
⏱️ Announcing timer start: Your 15 seconds begins now!
⏱️ Starting 15s countdown timer (mode: normal)
```

### 3. Test Multiple Words
First word might work, but test 3-5 words to verify consistency
