**Expected**:

- Error message: "Connection Timeout - Request took too long"
- Retry button should appear

### Common iOS Issues to Watch For

❌ **If buttons don't respond to taps:**
- This was the main bug - should be fixed now
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

❌ **If quiz never loads first word:**
- Check if intro speech played
- Try refreshing page
- Check network connection

❌ **If timer doesn't count down:**
- Check browser console for timer errors
- Try refreshing page

❌ **If fetch requests hang forever:**
- Should timeout after 10 seconds now
- Check error message appears

### Browser Compatibility

Test in multiple iOS browsers:

- [ ] Safari (primary browser)
- [ ] Chrome for iOS
- [ ] Edge for iOS

**Note**: All iOS browsers use Safari's WebKit engine, so behavior should be identical.

### Success Criteria

✅ **Speed Round is working on iOS if:**
1. All 4 buttons respond to taps immediately
2. Quiz progresses through words without hanging
3. Timer counts down smoothly
4. Keyboard Enter key submits answers
5. Results page appears after completing round
6. Timeout errors appear (not infinite loading) if network is slow

### If Issues Persist

1. **Check Railway logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Check browser console on iOS:**
   - Settings → Safari → Advanced → Web Inspector
   - Connect iPhone to Mac
   - Safari → Develop → [Your iPhone] → [Your Page]

3. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check Railway dashboard shows latest commit (eb7532f)
   - Verify build completed successfully

4. **Test on desktop first:**
   - If working on desktop but not iOS, issue is iOS-specific
   - If broken on both, check Railway deployment

### Rollback Command (if needed)

If Speed Round is still broken on iOS:

```bash
git revert eb7532f
git push origin main
```

This will undo the iOS fixes and restore previous version.
