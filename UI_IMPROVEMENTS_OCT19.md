# UI Improvements - Quiz & Avatar Picker - October 19, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Quiz Page - Mute Button Repositioning
**Issue:** Mute button was at the bottom of the card, hard to find

**Solution:** Moved the "Mute Buzzy" button to center of quiz card, right after the definition display

**Changes:**
- **File:** `templates/quiz.html`
- Moved voice toggle button from line 2042 (after voice visualizer) to line 2010 (after definition display)
- Button now appears centrally between the definition and the countdown timer
- Easier to access and more prominent placement

### 2. Avatar Picker - Bigger Thumbnails & Names
**Issue:** Avatar thumbnails were too small (100px), names hard to read (0.75rem font), inconsistent card sizes

**Solution:** Increased thumbnail size to 140px, larger font for names, consistent card heights

**Changes:**
- **File:** `templates/components/avatar_picker.html`

**Grid Updates:**
- Changed `grid-template-columns` from `minmax(140px, 1fr)` to `minmax(180px, 1fr)`
- Increased `gap` from `1rem` to `1.5rem`
- Increased `max-height` from `400px` to `500px`
- Added padding `1.5rem` (was `1rem`)

**Avatar Card Updates:**
- Increased `padding` from `0.75rem` to `1.25rem`
- Changed `border-radius` from `12px` to `16px`
- Set consistent height: `min-height: 220px` and `height: 220px`
- Removed `aspect-ratio: 1` (was causing size inconsistencies)
- Changed layout to `justify-content: center` for better centering

**Thumbnail Image Updates:**
- Increased size from `width: 100px; height: 100px` to `width: 140px; height: 140px` (**40% larger**)
- Increased `margin-bottom` from `0.5rem` to `0.75rem`

**Avatar Name Updates:**
- Increased font size from `0.75rem` to `0.95rem` (**27% larger**)
- Changed `font-weight` from `600` to `700` (bolder)
- Added `line-height: 1.3` for better readability

### 3. Quiz Definition Display - Better Formatting
**Issue:** Sometimes the target word appeared in the definition/sentence, giving away the answer

**Solution:** 
1. Backend now uses `get_word_info()` which properly formats definitions and blanks out the word
2. Frontend splits and styles definition vs. fill-in-the-blank sentence

**Backend Changes:**
- **File:** `AjaSpellBApp.py` - `/api/pronounce` endpoint (line 3472)
- Now calls `get_word_info(current_word)` which:
  - Returns kid-friendly definition from Simple Wiktionary (50K words)
  - Automatically blanks out the target word with `_____`
  - Formats as: "Definition. Fill in the blank: Example sentence with _____"
- Falls back to `_blank_word()` for any raw sentences

**Frontend Changes:**
- **File:** `templates/quiz.html`

**CSS Enhancements:**
```css
.definition-display {
    text-align: left;
    line-height: 1.6;
}

.word-definition {
    font-weight: 600;
    color: #8B6914;
    margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}

.sentence-example {
    font-style: italic;
    margin-top: 0.75rem;
    padding-top: 0.75rem;
    border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 193, 7, 0.3);
}

.blank-word {
    min-width: 80px;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #FFD700;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: #FF8C00;
}
```

**JavaScript Updates:**
- Modified `definitionElement` update (line 4587)
- Detects "Fill in the blank:" in definition text
- Splits into two parts:
  1. **Definition** - Shows with üìñ icon
  2. **Sentence** - Shows with ‚úèÔ∏è icon and "Fill in the blank:" label
- HTML formatting:
  ```html
  <div class="word-definition">üìñ Definition here</div>
  <div class="sentence-example">‚úèÔ∏è Fill in the blank: Example with _____</div>
  ```
