## 🎯 Points Calculation

### Base Points System

#### Correct Answer Base
```
Base Score: 100 points
```

#### Time Bonus
```
Time Bonus = 5 points × seconds remaining
Examples:
- 60s timer, answered in 10s → 50s remaining → 250 bonus points
- 60s timer, answered in 55s → 5s remaining → 25 bonus points
- Ran out of time → 0 bonus points
```

#### Streak Bonus
```
Streak Bonus = 10 points × current streak
Examples:
- 1st correct in a row → 10 points
- 3rd correct in a row → 30 points
- 10th correct in a row → 100 points
```

#### First Attempt Bonus
```
First Attempt: +50 points (no incorrect attempts before correct answer)
```

#### No Hints Bonus
```
No Hints Used: +25 points (didn't request hint, pronunciation, or definition)
```

### Example Calculations

#### Perfect Quick Answer
```

```
Word: "necessary"
Timer: 60 seconds
Answered in: 45 seconds
Attempts: 2
