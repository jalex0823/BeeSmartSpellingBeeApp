## 🔄 How Accumulation Works

### Every Time You Complete a Quiz:

1. **Quiz session saved** with grade and accuracy
2. **System automatically calls:** `current_user.update_gpa_and_accuracy()`
3. **This function:**
   - Queries **ALL** your completed quiz sessions from database
   - Converts each grade to GPA points (A+=4.0, B+=3.3, C=2.0, etc.)
   - Calculates average GPA from ALL quizzes
   - Calculates average accuracy from ALL quizzes
   - Finds your best grade ever
   - Finds your best streak ever
4. **Updates your user record** with cumulative stats
5. **Saves to database**
6. **Dashboard shows updated stats**

### Code Location:
- **models.py:84-136** - `User.update_gpa_and_accuracy()` method
- **AjaSpellBApp.py:3599** - Called after every quiz completion

### Key Code:
```python
def update_gpa_and_accuracy(self):
    # Query ALL completed quizzes for this user
    completed_sessions = QuizSession.query.filter_by(
        user_id=self.id,
        completed=True
    ).all()
    
    # Loop through every quiz
    for session in completed_sessions:
        total_gpa_points += grade_to_gpa[session.grade]
        total_accuracy += session.accuracy_percentage
    
    # Calculate cumulative averages
    self.cumulative_gpa = total_gpa_points / number_of_quizzes
    self.average_accuracy = total_accuracy / number_of_quizzes
```

## 📈 Example

If you complete 4 quizzes:

| Quiz | Accuracy | Grade | GPA | Points |
|------|----------|-------|-----|--------|
| 1    | 90%      | A-    | 3.7 | 500    |
| 2    | 85%      | B     | 3.0 | 850    |
| 3    | 100%     | A+    | 4.0 | 1200   |
| 4    | 80%      | B-    | 2.7 | 400    |

**Your Dashboard Shows:**
- **Cumulative GPA**: (3.7 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 2.7) / 4 = **3.35**
- **Average Accuracy**: (90 + 85 + 100 + 80) / 4 = **88.75%**
- **Best Grade**: **A+** (from Quiz 3)
- **Best Streak**: Highest from all 4 quizzes
- **Total Quizzes**: **4**
- **Total Points**: 500 + 850 + 1200 + 400 = **2,950**
