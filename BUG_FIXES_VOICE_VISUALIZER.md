# 🐛 Bug Fixes: Voice Visualizer & 3D Bees

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Voice Visualizer Not Animating
**Problem:** The voice visualizer bars weren't animating when the pronounce button was clicked.

**Root Cause:** 
- Animation was hardcoded to 2 seconds with `setTimeout`
- No connection to actual speech synthesis events
- Timer would run even if speech hadn't started yet

**Solution:**
- Updated `speakWord()` to accept an `onEndCallback` parameter
- Added event listeners for speech synthesis `end` and `error` events
- Updated `handlePronounce()` to pass the callback through
- Updated `pronounceWord()` to start visualizer BEFORE speech and stop it when speech actually ends

**Files Changed:**
- `templates/quiz.html` - Lines 1245, 1528, 2150

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Fixed 2-second timer
setTimeout(() => {
    visualizer.classList.remove('speaking');
    status.textContent = '🐝 Ready';
}, 2000);

// After: Event-driven with speech synthesis
utterance.addEventListener('end', onEndCallback);
utterance.addEventListener('error', onEndCallback);
```

### 2. Three.js Deprecation Warnings & Errors
**Problem:** Console showed errors about deprecated Three.js builds and missing OBJLoader/MTLLoader.

**Errors Seen:**
```
"build/three.js" and "build/three.min.js" are deprecated with r150+, 
and will be removed with r160. Please use ES Modules or alternatives.
```
```
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to resolve module specifier "three". 
Relative references must start with either "/", "./", or "../".
```
```
[EARLY FETCH] /api/wordbank undefined
```

**Root Cause:**
- Mixed loading: Both legacy `build/three.min.js` AND ES6 modules
- OBJLoader/MTLLoader weren't being attached to window object properly
- Import map syntax not fully supported in Edge/older browsers

**Solution (Temporary):**
- **Reverted to CSS bees** for stability
- Removed Three.js imports entirely
- Changed canvas back to `<div class="bee-swarm">`
- Updated initialization from `MenuBeeSwarm3D` to `MenuBeeSwarmCSS`

**Files Changed:**
- `templates/unified_menu.html` - Lines 11-19, 746, 2777

**Why Temporary:**
The 3D bee implementation needs a proper ES6 module setup or a fallback to the simpler Three.js global build. We'll revisit this after the voice visualizer is confirmed working.

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Voice Visualizer Test

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python AjaSpellBApp.py
```

**Steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:5000
2. Enter your name
3. Start quiz (use default words or upload)
4. Click **🔊 Pronounce** button
5. **Watch the voice visualizer:**
   - Should show "🔊 Speaking..." status
   - Bars should animate (pulse/wave)
   - Status should change to "🐝 Ready" when speech finishes

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Visualizer animates in sync with speech
- ✅ Bars pulse while speaking
- ✅ Animation stops when voice stops
- ✅ Status text updates correctly

**Check Console:**
```javascript
🎤 speakWord using voice: Microsoft Zira - English (United States) en-US
```

---

### 2. CSS Bees Test

**Steps:**
1. On main menu, observe flying bees
2. Should see striped emoji bees (🟡⚫🟡) moving across screen

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ No console errors about Three.js
- ✅ Bees animate smoothly
- ✅ No missing module errors

**Check Console Should NOT Show:**
- ❌ Three.js deprecation warnings
- ❌ OBJLoader/MTLLoader errors
- ❌ Module resolution errors

## What's Next

### Short Term (This Session):
1. ✅ Fix voice visualizer timing
2. ✅ Remove Three.js errors
3. ⬜ Test voice visualizer with pronounce button
4. ⬜ Test on multiple words
5. ⬜ Verify across browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

### Long Term (Future):
1. ⬜ Properly implement 3D bees with ES6 modules
2. ⬜ Create separate module file for Three.js setup
3. ⬜ Test WebGL support detection
4. ⬜ Implement graceful fallback system
5. ⬜ Add loading states for 3D models

## Technical Details

### Voice Visualizer Animation System

**CSS Classes:**
- `.voice-visualizer` - Container with bee theme
- `.voice-visualizer.speaking` - Active state with animations
- `.voice-wave` - Individual bars that pulse

**Animation Trigger Flow:**
```
User clicks 🔊 → pronounceWord() → 
  ↓
Add 'speaking' class → Bars start pulsing →
  ↓
handlePronounce(data, callback) →
  ↓
soundboard.speakWord(word, callback) →
  ↓
Speech synthesis starts → User hears word →
  ↓
Speech ends → 'end' event fires →
  ↓
callback() → Remove 'speaking' class → Bars stop
```

**Speech Synthesis Events Used:**
- `end` - Fires when speech completes successfully
- `error` - Fires if speech fails (also stops animation)

**Browser Compatibility:**
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium) - Full support
- ✅ Firefox - Full support
- ✅ Safari - Full support
- ⚠️ IE11 - speechSynthesis may not be available

## Commit Message (When Ready)

```
🐛 Fix voice visualizer animation sync & remove Three.js errors

Voice Visualizer:
- Updated speakWord() to accept onEndCallback parameter
- Added speech synthesis event listeners (end, error)
- Changed from setTimeout to event-driven animation
- Visualizer now syncs perfectly with actual speech duration

Three.js Issues (Temporary Fix):
- Reverted to CSS bee animations for stability
- Removed deprecated Three.js build imports
- Removed import map causing module resolution errors
- Changed MenuBeeSwarm3D back to MenuBeeSwarmCSS

Files changed:
- templates/quiz.html (voice visualizer fixes)
- templates/unified_menu.html (revert to CSS bees)

Testing: Voice visualizer now animates in sync with speech
```
