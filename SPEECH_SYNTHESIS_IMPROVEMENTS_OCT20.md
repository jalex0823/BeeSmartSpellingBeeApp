# Speech Synthesis Improvements - October 20, 2024

## Overview
Implemented three critical user experience improvements to the Speed Round speech synthesis system to make announcements more natural and prevent accidental answer reveals.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Sporadic Name Announcements
**Problem:** Announcer said user's name with every single word ("Your next word is..." for every word), creating a robotic and repetitive experience.

**Solution:** Implemented counter-based sporadic announcements:
- Added `wordsUntilNameAnnouncement` counter variable
- Only announces "Your next word is..." every 3-5 words
- For other words, uses simple "Next..." transition
- Counter randomized between 3-5 to feel more natural

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Added state variable
let wordsUntilNameAnnouncement = 0; // 0 = announce now

// Modified announceWord() function
const shouldAnnounceName = wordsUntilNameAnnouncement <= 0;

if (shouldAnnounceName) {
    announcement = "Your next word is...";
    wordsUntilNameAnnouncement = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 3; // Reset to 3-5
} else {
    announcement = "Next...";
    wordsUntilNameAnnouncement--;
}
```

**Result:** Users now hear full announcement every 3-5 words instead of every single word, making the experience feel more conversational and less repetitive.

### 2. ✅ Added Pause Between Announcement and Word
**Problem:** Announcement and word pronunciation ran together without break, making it hard to distinguish between instruction and actual word.

**Solution:** Increased pause from 400ms to 500ms in the `utterance.onend` callback:
- Announcement plays first
- 500ms pause
- Then word is pronounced

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
utterance.onend = () => {
    visualizer.classList.remove('speaking');
    status.textContent = '🐝 Ready';
    // Add 500ms pause between announcement and word pronunciation
    setTimeout(() => {
        pronounceWord();
    }, 500); // Changed from 400ms
};

utterance.onerror = () => {
    visualizer.classList.remove('speaking');
    // Pronounce anyway if there's an error (with same pause)
    setTimeout(() => {
        pronounceWord();
    }, 500);
};
```

**Result:** Clear separation between "Your next word is..." and the actual word pronunciation, preventing them from running together.

### 3. ✅ Masked Target Word in Definitions and Sentences
**Problem:** Users could see the word they're supposed to spell in the definition or example sentence, defeating the purpose of the quiz.

**Solution:** Created word masking function that replaces target word with underscores:
- Added `maskTargetWord(text, targetWord)` function
- Uses regex with word boundaries for accurate matching
- Replaces word with `_____` (5 underscores)
- Applied to definition, hint, and sentence before display

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// New masking function
function maskTargetWord(text, targetWord) {
    if (!text || !targetWord) return text;
    
    // Create regex that matches the word with word boundaries (case-insensitive)
    const escapedWord = targetWord.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
    const regex = new RegExp(`\\b${escapedWord}\\b`, 'gi');
    
    // Replace with underscores
    return text.replace(regex, '_____');
}

// Applied in loadNextWord()
const maskedDefinition = maskTargetWord(data.definition, data.word);
wordPrompt.textContent = maskedDefinition;

currentHint = maskTargetWord(data.hint || '', data.word);
currentSentence = maskTargetWord(data.sentence || '', data.word);
```

**Example:**
- Original: "A _____ is a large, striped cat that lives in Asia."
- Target word: "tiger"
- Masked: "A _____ is a large, striped cat that lives in Asia."

**Result:** Users can no longer cheat by reading the target word in the definition, hint, or example sentence.

## User Experience Impact

### Before
- 😫 "Your next word is... cat"
- 😫 "Your next word is... dog"
- 😫 "Your next word is... bird"
- 🤔 Words run together without pause
- 😠 Can see answer in definition: "A **cat** is a small furry animal"

### After
- 😊 "Your next word is... cat" *(pause)* "Next... dog" *(pause)* "Next... bird" *(pause)* "Your next word is... mouse"
- ✅ Clear 500ms pause between announcement and word
- 🎯 Definition shows: "A **_____** is a small furry animal"

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to Railway
2. Test Speed Round with multiple users
3. Monitor for speech synthesis errors
4. Gather user feedback on announcement frequency
5. Consider adjusting 3-5 word range if needed (could be 4-7, 2-4, etc.)

## Notes
- Random range (3-5 words) chosen to feel natural and unpredictable
- 500ms pause tested across multiple devices (desktop, mobile)
- Word masking uses word boundaries to avoid partial matches
- Regex escaping handles special characters in target words
- All changes maintain iOS compatibility with existing fixes
