🐝 BeeSmart Spelling App — Comprehensive Improvement Checklist
0) Release Framing

 Version tag: v1.4 → v1.5 scope defined and changelog drafted (P0)

 Branching: create feature branches per section (e.g., feature/menu-upload, feature/dictionary-builder, etc.) (P0)

1) Main Menu & Navigation

 Opening Menu with 3 options (Upload Word List, Upload Image, Start Quiz) (P0)
DoD: Menu renders cleanly; Start Quiz disabled until valid input loaded; tooltips on each option.

 Remove rocking bees & flowers from header (P0)
DoD: No bee/flower DOM nodes/assets; no console warnings about missing assets.

 Fairy animation with dust trail (P1)
DoD: Fairy sprite/path animation + GPU particle trail (fade ~1.5s); respects reduced-motion setting.

 Start Quiz validation (P0)
DoD: Cannot proceed unless at least one: parsed text list, parsed file list, or OCR list exists; error banner if user clicks prematurely.

2) Word Ingestion (Text / Files)

 Paste & Plain Text Upload (.txt, raw textarea) (P0)
DoD: Accepts newline, comma-, or space-separated; trims punctuation; de-dupes case-insensitively.

 CSV Upload (.csv) (P0)
DoD: Detects delimiter (,/;/\t), header/no-header; chooses column by selector; preview table before confirm.

 DOCX Upload (.docx) (P1)
DoD: Extracts paragraphs; filters non-word content; supports simple bullets and numbered lists.

 Robust parser (P0)
DoD: Shared sanitizer: remove numerals/indices, strip non-alpha except hyphen/apostrophe, enforce a–z only mode toggle.

3) Image → Words (OCR)

 Image upload (.jpg/.png/.webp/.pdf[1p]) (P0)
DoD: Validates size; shows preview; warns on low DPI.

 OCR extraction (Tesseract/EasyOCR) (P0)
DoD: Batch detect words (A–Z); ignores headers/footers; confidence threshold; user review list → approve.

 Post-OCR cleanup (P0)
DoD: Deduplicate; spell-check suggestion for weird tokens; allow manual edit before saving.

4) Dictionary Creation & Enrichment

 Local cache data/dictionary.json (P0)
DoD: Schema { word: { definition, example, phonetic, pos?, ipa? } }; persisted; readable; migration safe.

 API lookup (Free Dictionary API or pluggable) (P0)
DoD: For missing words only; retry/backoff; circuit-breaker on repeated errors; respectful rate limiting.

 Kid-friendly normalization (P0)
DoD: Single-sentence definitions when possible; examples scrub word → “_____”; fallback templates provided.

 Phonetics (P0)
DoD: Use API phonetic if present; fallback heuristic syllable splitter; later: plug g2p_en for higher quality.

 Batch builder (P0)
DoD: build_dictionary(words[]) returns enriched entries; progress bar + error summary UI.

5) Quiz Engine & UX

 Formatted quiz lines: word|definition|Example: The _____ ... (P0)
DoD: Generated from dictionary; order preserved; exportable/previewable.

 Misspelling feedback → Show phonetics (P0)
DoD: On incorrect answer: show phonetic string (and optional TTS); allow “Try again” then reveal correct spelling.

 Disable “Listen for Answer” (P0)
DoD: Mic button removed; code path stubbed with feature flag; no permission prompts.

 Scoring logic (P1)
DoD: Configurable attempts; partial credit on second try; per-round stats.

6) Audio/TTS (optional now, prep for later)

 Word pronunciation (TTS) (P2)
DoD: Uses Web Speech API or cloud TTS; voice selection menu; rate/pitch sliders; offline fallback text display.

 Audio cues (P2)
DoD: Correct/incorrect subtle sounds; respect “mute” and reduced-motion/accessibility preferences.

7) Accessibility & Internationalization

 A11y: keyboard nav, focus order, ARIA labels (P0)
DoD: All actionable elements tabbable; visible focus; menu/alerts have ARIA roles; meets WCAG AA contrast.

 Reduced motion support (P0)
DoD: Prefers-reduced-motion disables particle trail intensity & long animations.

 Locale scaffolding (P2)
DoD: Strings moved to i18n file; date/number formatting ready; English default.

8) Data Model & Persistence

 Session state (P0)
DoD: Current word list, progress, score persisted (localStorage/IndexedDB); resume session.

 Export/Import (P1)
DoD: Export enriched set as CSV/JSON; re-import supported; includes definitions & examples.

9) Error Handling & Messaging

 Unified toast/banner system (P0)
DoD: Success, warning, error variants; deduplication; auto-dismiss w/ hover pause.

 Per-stage validation (P0)
DoD: Clear guidance: why a step fails and how to fix (e.g., “Need at least 5 words,” “Image too low-res,” etc.).

 Offline mode cues (P1)
DoD: If API unreachable, proceed with cached words; show “Some definitions pending—will fill as available.”

10) Performance

 Lazy load OCR & TTS libs (P1)
DoD: Initial bundle stays small; load-on-demand; spinner & cancellable loads.

 Debounce parsing (P1)
DoD: Large paste doesn’t freeze UI; parse in worker for >2k tokens.

 Image downscale (P1)
DoD: Pre-OCR downscale to sensible max dimension to improve speed.

11) Security & Privacy

 No PII collection by default (P0)
DoD: Local-only by default; if cloud used, explicit opt-in + notice.

 Content safety for kids (P0)
DoD: Filter out adult definitions if API returns unsuitable content; fallback to neutral wording.

 CSP & dependency audit (P1)
DoD: Basic CSP headers; audit third-party libs; pin versions.

12) Analytics (teacher/parent-friendly)

 Local analytics (P2)
DoD: Aggregate: attempts per word, accuracy %, tricky words list; export as CSV.

 Heatmap of misses (P2)
DoD: Surface the top 10 hardest words per session.

13) QA & Testing

 Unit tests (P0)
DoD: Parsers, dictionary builder, phonetic fallback covered; ≥80% for core utilities.

 Integration tests (P1)
DoD: Upload → dictionary build → quiz flow; OCR path happy-case.

 UX test scripts (P1)
DoD: Manual QA checklist for all major flows, including accessibility checks.

 Sample fixtures (P0)
DoD: Include sample: words.txt, words.csv, list.docx, sheet.jpg (clear 300 DPI) for repeatable tests.

14) DevOps / Build & Deploy

 Environment config (P0)
DoD: .env template; API base URL; feature flags (ENABLE_MIC, ENABLE_TTS, ENABLE_OCR).

 CI pipeline (P0)
DoD: Lint + test on PR; build artifact; status badge.

 Railway deploy (P0)
DoD: Dockerfile; healthcheck; logs; environment secrets (if any).

 Versioned releases (P1)
DoD: GitHub Releases with notes & downloadable sample sets.

15) UI Polish & Content

 Modern theme pass (P1)
DoD: Consistent spacing, rounded corners, subtle shadows; scalable to tablet/desktop; dark mode compatible.

 Help/Onboarding (P1)
DoD: One-page “How to upload,” “How OCR works,” “Privacy,” “Tips for better recognition.”

 Empty states (P0)
DoD: Friendly guidance when no words loaded or OCR returns nothing.

16) Stretch Goals

 PWA support (installable) (P2)
DoD: Service worker cache for dictionary and app shell; offline quiz for cached sets.

 Teacher mode (P3)
DoD: Create/share sets; print worksheet with blanks.

 User profiles (local) (P3)
DoD: Multiple learners with separate progress.

Acceptance Criteria Cheat-Sheet (Core P0)

Start Quiz disabled until valid list exists.

Word ingestion works for paste + .txt + .csv; docx optional (P1).

Image→OCR pipeline returns clean list with review step.

Dictionary cache auto-builds missing entries via API and saves to dictionary.json.

Quiz uses format word|definition|Example: The _____ ....

On misspell, phonetic string is shown; mic feature removed from UI.

Bees/flowers gone; fairy trail present or gracefully reduced if “reduced motion” is on.

Unit tests pass; CI green; Railway deploy succeeds.
