# Start Fresh Bug Fix - Complete Reset

## Issue
When clicking "Start Fresh" button, the app was clearing the word list but then automatically reloading the default 50 words from `50Words_kidfriendly.txt`. This prevented users from truly starting with an empty state.

## Root Cause
The `get_wordbank()` function (lines 582-591 in `AjaSpellBApp.py`) has logic to auto-load default words for new sessions:

```python
# Smart default word loading: Only for NEW sessions (first visit)
if not wb and not session.get("skip_default_load", False) and not session.get("has_uploaded_once", False):
    default_words = load_default_wordbank()
    # ... loads 50 default words
```

The `/api/clear` endpoint was **clearing** these flags:
- `session.pop("skip_default_load", None)` 
- `session.pop("has_uploaded_once", None)`

This made the session look "new" again, triggering auto-load of defaults on the next page refresh.

## Solution
Changed `/api/clear` endpoint to **SET** these flags instead of clearing them:

```python
# CRITICAL: Prevent auto-loading defaults after explicit clear
# User explicitly cleared everything, so don't auto-load defaults
session["skip_default_load"] = True
session["has_uploaded_once"] = True  # Treat as if user has used the app before
```

## Result
- ✅ "Start Fresh" now completely clears the app to **0 words**
- ✅ Quiz button remains disabled until user uploads new words
- ✅ No automatic reload of default words after explicit clear
- ✅ Default words still load for first-time visitors (unchanged behavior)

## Testing
1. Start app with default words loaded
2. Click "Start Fresh" → Confirm twice
3. Page reloads → Should show "0 words loaded"
4. Quiz button should be disabled
5. Upload new words → App works normally

## Files Modified
- `AjaSpellBApp.py` (lines 1461-1472): Updated `/api/clear` endpoint to prevent default word auto-loading
